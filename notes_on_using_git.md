# setting up git for statgl
This guide will contain my experiences throught the search for git integration
with Rstuio for R development at statgl.
 
At the beginning of this tutorial Lars P has gotten IT support to install git,
git bash, git shell and git gui on the H drive.
 
Following the guide happygitwithr.com this guide assumes the repositories to be
stored locally and pushed to github.com. Lars P would like the option for self 
hosting to be explored. This could be GitLabs or Gitea.


 
I have previously used ssh connection to github
