This notebook is meant as a learning-by-doing example for me `r params$author`
document my thoughts an experiences trying to implement git into the work 
rutines of statgl using Rstuido. 

# Introduction

This guide will contain my experiences throughout the search for git integration
with Rstudio for R development at statgl.
 
At the beginning of this tutorial Lars P has gotten IT support to install git,
git bash, git shell and git gui on the H drive.
 
Following the guide [Happy git with R](http://www.happygitwithr.com) this guide
assumes the repositories to be stored locally and pushed to github.com. 
Lars P would like the option for self hosting to be explored. 

This could be GitLabs or Gitea. My gut feeling is that this should be outsourced to github or gitlab EE. 


 
I have previously used ssh connection to github and so will continue using SSH although Happy git with R suggest https PAT tokens.


Issues trouble shooting git tab in Rstudio. The git executable on windows should be placed correctly.

use "where git" in H dirve to find on C:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmd\\git.exe and follow this guide [Mike Nguyen](https://mikenguyen.netlify.app/post/missing-git-tab-in-rstudio-on-windows-computer/)


### It is an issue that one cannot remove files from command line using rm / rm -r or git rm 

testing if the git GUi function in collboration with Rstduio

### When opening an exisitng directory under version control e.i git init from command line

follow the explanation here [Guide on posit](support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200532077).\\
in short
\item execute *New project* from p√•roject menu
\item create new project from an existing directory
\item select apporproate directory and click *create project*

This is counter intuitive to me that I cannot just open any file or project
existing in the directory that I have initialized a git repository in but I have
to open a new project from an existing project from **within** Rstudio.


For python to work "png" and "reticulate" should be updated in the base installation 
```{python}
import numpy as np

x = 2 + 2
print(x)
```
