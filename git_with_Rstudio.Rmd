This notebook is meant as a learning-by-doing example for me `r params$author`
document my thoughts an experiences trying to implement git into the work 
rutines of statgl using Rstuido. 

# Introduction

This guide will contain my experiences throughout the search for git integration
with Rstudio for R development at statgl.
 
At the beginning of this tutorial Lars P has gotten IT support to install git,
git bash, git shell and git gui on the H drive.
 
Following the guide [Happy git with R](http://www.happygitwithr.com) this guide
assumes the repositories to be stored locally and pushed to github.com. 
Lars P would like the option for self hosting to be explored. 

This could be GitLabs or Gitea. My gut feeling is that this should be outsourced to github or gitlab EE. 


 
I have previously used ssh connection to github and so will continue using SSH although Happy git with R suggest https PAT tokens.


Issues trouble shooting git tab in Rstudio. The git executable on windows should be placed correctly.

use "where git" in H dirve to find on C:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmd\\git.exe and follow this guide [Mike Nguyen](https://mikenguyen.netlify.app/post/missing-git-tab-in-rstudio-on-windows-computer/) ***OBS*** following Happy Git with R the /cmd/ folder should never be used instead point to /bin/git.exe



### It is an issue that one cannot remove files from command line using rm / rm -r or git rm 

testing if the git GUi function in collboration with Rstduio

### When opening an exisitng directory under version control e.i git init from command line

follow the explanation here [Guide on posit](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200532077).

In short

 * execute *New project* from project menu
 * create new project from an existing directory
 * select apporproate directory and click *create project*


This is counter intuitive to me that I cannot just open any file or project
existing in the directory that I have initialized a git repository in but I have
to open a new project from an existing project from **within** Rstudio.


For python to work "png" and "reticulate" should be updated in the base installation 
```{python}
import numpy as np

x = 2 + 2
print(x)
```


## Getting git to work in Rstudio
continued issues with this. I thought the issues where related to the placement of git originally pointed to the /cmd/ which is a no go instead Rstudio should point to the git in the /bin/

 * existing project without version control
 * existing project with version
 
However, the issue with opening existing projects under version control (e.i. git ini from command line can come from the administrators having ownership of different folders with the ID: 'S-1-5-32-544' a known administrator group id in windows accoring to [TheCodingAnalyst](https://medium.com/@thecodinganalyst/git-detect-dubious-ownership-in-repository-e7f33037a8f)
