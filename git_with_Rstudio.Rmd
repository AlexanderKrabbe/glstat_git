This notebook is meant as a learning-by-doing example for me `r params$author`
document my thoughts an experiences trying to implement git into the work 
rutines of statgl using Rstuido. 

# Introduction

This guide will contain my experiences throughout the search for git integration
with Rstudio for R development at statgl.
 
At the beginning of this tutorial Lars P has gotten IT support to install git,
git bash, git shell and git gui on the H drive.
 
Following the guide [Happy git with R](http://www.happygitwithr.com) this guide
assumes the repositories to be stored locally and pushed to github.com. 
Lars P would like the option for self hosting to be explored. 

This could be GitLabs or Gitea. My gut feeling is that this should be outsourced to github or gitlab EE. 


 
I have previously used ssh connection to github and so will continue using SSH although Happy git with R suggest https PAT tokens.




Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 


```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
